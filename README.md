# GraphCalculator
It's my first attempt to make some sort of MVC app. This simple graphing calculator can parse math equations and plot functions.

To plot a graph, click *"Graph"* and input some function.

***EVERY OPERATOR, LITERAL AND FUNCTION SHOULD BE SEPARATED WITH SPACES.***

For example:
```
  2 * sin ( x )
  
  exp ( 1 / x )
  
  ( x + 2 ) / ( x - 2 )
```
You can use variables to add flexibility to your functions and watch how they change.
To create them, click *"Variable"*, enter it's name. There are slider, when you can easily change variable value, you just need to input minimum and maximum value for the slider. Then use name of variable like any literal, inside your functions.

*"Function"* button doesn't do anything for now.
